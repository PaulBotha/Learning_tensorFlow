Some definitions:

* Scalar: a single num (0-Dimentional tensor)
* Vector: num with direction (1-Dimentional tensor)
* Matrix: 2D array of num
* Tensor: n-Dimentional arrary of num

ndim : check dimentions

Ctrl MM (makes it a note)
Shift Enter (new command line)

# Import TensorFlow (first thing we need to do)
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__);

# Create scalar with tf.constant() 
scalar = tf.constant(7)
scalar

# check the number of dimension of a tensor (ndim: number of dimentions)
scalar.ndim

scalar can be replaced with vector, matrix, tensor
